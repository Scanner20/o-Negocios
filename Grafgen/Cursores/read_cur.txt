Here's 62 PLAIN Cursors. If your like me, you enjoy animated cursors
when your in "busy" or "Working in background" mode. But can find them
somewhat distracting when you're working on a spreadsheet or other 
application.

These are free, I've got some good free desktop enhancements from
the web and want to return the favor. let me know what you think!

Enjoy,
