glyFX Image Library - LMD Component Support
===========================================


IML format image lists are designed for use with LMD Component libraries, which can be found at http://www.lmd.de

Previously, these files were included in our installation by default, however to reduce the size of our installation programs, the compiled LMD ImageList files are now available as a seperate download.

Please contact us at info@glyfx.com for details on how to get the LMD files.
