You may use and distribute the stuff I have freely given in whatever way you deem useful, profitable, or fun as long as you adhere to the restrictions listed below. It is not important that you give me personal credit for the work, but it is important that you...

	* Don’t sue me for any damages resulting from the use or abuse of my stuff.
	* Don’t misrepresent the origin of my stuff.

Much of the stuff I share was created while standing on the shoulders of giants, so any additional restrictions, licensing, and/or copyrights that the giants have imposed on their portion of the work must be respected. Why? Because they’re fricking giants, and we DO NOT want to make them angry!
