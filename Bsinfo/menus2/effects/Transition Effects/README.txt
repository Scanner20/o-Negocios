Transition Effects is a new way for Windows.Form rendering. It's of course isn't %100 managed code. Because Bitmap functions already uses pointers. Some people thinks such an algorithm can not be high performance. But it isn't true. I use sometime GDI functions instead of GDI+ . So performance isn't a problem.
You can use this library freely. It's have some bugs especially scrollable controls. Maybe you can find another bugs that i haven't seen. My email address is serdardirican@gmail.com Don't hesitate to write me.
I must to find a sponsor to continue this project. Otherwise i break to working o it.
